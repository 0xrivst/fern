# fern

> Frugal Ethereal encRypted pastebiN in a single HTML file

## Features

-   LZMA compression.
-   Everything in a single HTML file. Portable and easily transportable.
-   AES-GCM encryption using web Crypto API (no third-party dependencies) with PBKDF2 for key derivation.
-   Pastes are decrypted in-place - plaintext exists only after explicitly decrypting. Refresh or close the page and it's back to ciphertext.

_fern_ supports two "modes of operation": online and offline. "Online" mode assumes being deployed on a server and retrieving pastes from URL params. In this case you simply share the link, which contains the encrypted compressed paste and the recipient decrypts it with a passcode. "Offline" mode means using `fern.html` to create pastes and save each one as a new file that contains the paste 'baked in' and the logic for decrypting and decompressing it (and also can be used for creating new pastes).
